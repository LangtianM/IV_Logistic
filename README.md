# Confounded Logistic Model with Instrumental Variables

This repository contains my undergraduate thesis and source code to produce experiments results for the project. It analyzed the bias of instrumental variable estimators in confounded logistic models under model misspecification and proposed a residual-based method to mitigate confounding bias, with theoretical conditions and empirical validations.
